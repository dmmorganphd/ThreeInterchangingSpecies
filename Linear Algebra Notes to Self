From Strang, Chapter 6

Eigenvalues are useful in the description of problems in which 
the solution is a function of time. 

Eigenvectors are those vectors which are changed only in length in 
left multiplication by AA. That is, for an eigenvector xx:

AA xx = lambda xx

in which lambda is the corresponding eigenvalue. 

Rearranging: 

AA xx - lambda xx = 00

(AA - lambda II) xx = 00

Therefore xx is an eigenvector of AA if it is in the nullspace of 
(AA - lambda II).

To find the eigenvalues: 

det(AA - lambda II) = 0


See p 261 of Strang. He's hard to understand, so I rephrase in my own words: sets of differential equations which are linear and which have constant coefficients may be converted directly into linear algebra for solution using: 

d/dt uu
