Describes the equilibrium in which species A is in equilibrium with species B, 
which is in equilbrium with species C, which is in equilibrium with species 
A. Microscopic rate constants may be user-chosen. 

Presents the set of coupled differential equations which describe the time-
evolution of the system. Boundary conditions may be user-chosen

Solves the set of equations using the eigenvalue / eigenvector method, and 
discusses the physical meanings of the eigenvectors.
